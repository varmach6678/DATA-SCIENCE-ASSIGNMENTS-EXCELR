These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

In fact, it instructs one to kill under\\n#certain circumstances.     \\n\\nI'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly\\nharmless.\\n#\\n#|> For my part, I conclude that something\\n#|> else is required.

And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|> #being religiously motivated.\\n#|> \\n#|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|> he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated.\\n#\\n#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic \\n#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?\\n\\nNot in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \\\"religion did this\\\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.

But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \"religion did this\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's\\nnot nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart\\nfrom violence of course.\\n#\\n#|> #It's not an abstract \"argument\".

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

In fact, it instructs one to kill under\\n#certain circumstances.     \\n\\nI'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly\\nharmless.\\n#\\n#|&gt; For my part, I conclude that something\\n#|&gt; else is required.  I also happen to believe that that something\\n#|&gt; else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will\\n#|&gt; do.\\n#\\n#And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?\\n\\nNot necessarily.  \"Love thy neighbour\" does not supply a them/us - it\\ndemolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|&gt; #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|&gt; #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|&gt; #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|&gt; #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|&gt; #being religiously motivated.\\n#|&gt; \\n#|&gt; No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|&gt; he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated.\\n#\\n#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic \\n#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?\\n\\nNot in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \"religion did this\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|&gt; Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|&gt; and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's\\nnot nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart\\nfrom violence of course.\\n#\\n#|&gt; #It's not an abstract \"argument\".   Northern Irish Protestants say\\n#|&gt; #\"We don't want to be absorbed into am officially Catholic country.\"\\n#|&gt; #\\n#|&gt; #Now what are we supposed to do?   Are we supposed to reply \"No,\\n#|&gt; #that's only what you think you don't want.   Mr O'Dwyer assures us\\n#|&gt; #that no matter what you say you want, you really want something \\n#|&gt; #else?\"\\n#|&gt; \\n#|&gt; You think the Unionists wouldn't mind being absorbed into a non-Catholic \\n#|&gt; country (other than the UK of course)?   It's a terrible thing to lose\\n#|&gt; a mind.   Maybe the word \"country\" is there for more than just kicks.\\n#|&gt; I certainly don't believe that the Unionists are in it for God - I think\\n#|&gt; they wish to maintain their position of privilege.\\n#\\n#I'm still listening to what they say, and you are still telling us \\n#your version of what they think.   You read minds, and I don't.\\n\\nYou've speculated on my motives often enough, and you don't take\\nmy statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim \\nnot to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   I also note that \\nyou fail to answer my question.  It just looks to me very much like\\nyou have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what \\nmost Protestants say - which is @stop the killing\".  The people you\\nrefer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants.\\n#\\n#As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion-\\n#based?\\n\\nIt is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.

Fordham) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is \\nextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal \\ninfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

One can argue about\\n&gt;   the initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts get\\n&gt;   lost, that\\n&gt;\\n&gt;\\t   1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming\\n&gt;\\t   during the initial raid.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;\\t   2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Sigh, I was waiting some some not-so-intelligent person to bring this\\n&gt;up.  Look, this is a country of laws. To quote a piece of parchment\\n&gt;that many seem to think is of little importance:\\n&gt;\\n&gt; 4th Amendment\\n&gt; The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \\n&gt; papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, \\n&gt; shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon \\n&gt; probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and \\n&gt; particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons \\n&gt; or things to be seized. \\n\\n\\tThe first question is, \"Did the 'tip-off' call indicate to the\\nBranch Davidians that a \"no-knock warrant\" was in use (and they could\\ntherefore presumably go into 'Weapons Free' once the compound property \\nwas entered ?\" The second question is, \"What makes Gerry think that the\\nDavidians' actions would have been different had another type of warrant\\nbeen in use ?\"\\n\\n\\tI'd like to see both of these questions answered before seeking\\njudgment as to any claims about my IQ.\\n\\n&gt;\\n&gt;No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment.\\n&gt;Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't\\n&gt;have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug\\n&gt;dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and\\n&gt;tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So,\\n&gt;being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of\\n&gt;the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only\\n&gt;acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound\\n&gt;paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few\\n&gt;federal officers make knock some sense back into it.\\n\\n\\tA spurious analogy, especially for one so skeptical as Gerry. \\nThe Davidians were NOT drug dealers, and by all accounts feared no one\\nbut the Feds. Any evidence to the contrary ?\\n\\n\\n\\nBill R.\\n\\n--\\n\\n\"When up a dangerous faction starts,         \"My opinions do not represent\\nWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer or\\nBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency.\"\\nTo ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1992)\\nTo turn religion to a fable,\\nAnd turn the Government to a Babel;\\nPervert the law, disgrace the gown,\\nCorrupt the senate, rob the crown;\\nTo sacrifice old England's glory,\\nAnd make her infamous in story.\\nWhen such a tempest shook the land,\\nHow could unguarded virtue stand ?\"\\n- Jonathan Swift (1732)\\n</th>\n",

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.

You still haven't offered\\n\\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\\ndo this.\\n\\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\\nus alive.\\n\\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\\nknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\\nWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\\nwhatever it takes.\\n\\nRick.\\n</th>\n",

Automatic weapons, grenades, rocket launchers? The sorts of things\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;no family should be without, I guess. Anyway, I've often wondered what\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;business followers of Christ would have with weapons. It's hard to imagine a\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pistol-packin' Jesus, though I suppose a pump-action shotgun would have\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;made clearing the temple a hell of a lot easier.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Luke's account of the Last Supper.  \"...sell your cloak and buy a\\n&gt; sword.\"  Peter carried a sword (scene in Gethsemane).\\n&gt; \\n\\nI'm not expert on Christianity, but I know a little about history\\nand how the repeated instances of Messianic figures (jesus was neither\\nthe first, last nor most serious of those pretenders) related\\nto the history of the period.\\n\\nA messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the Romans!\\nHe was supposed to reclaim Israel and Judaea, bring the Israelites\\nback from what is now Iraq-Persia-Afghanistan, and do so\\nnot only by faith, but by real war.  Any Messianic pretender\\nwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since they\\nwere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free the\\nIsraelites.\\n\\nFor those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far more\\nseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and\\n600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was only\\nrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he looked\\nas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins before\\nthe Romans triumphed.\\n\\nNow how that has played into Christianity is rather interesting\\ngiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koresh\\nfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?\\nHad he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of\\nthe Israelites? (one hint, almost none of them are Christians,\\nlook at the three countries listed above, they were their\\nand Jewish until at least the 10th century)\\n\\n\\t\\tSeth Rosenthal\\n\\nDisclaimer: All opinions are my own not my employers'.\\n\\n</th>\n",

From the time he is born, the\\n&gt;&gt;      theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n&gt;&gt;      \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n&gt;&gt;      the Torah, the Qur'an, &amp; etc.  He is told\\n&gt;&gt;      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n&gt;&gt;      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n&gt;&gt;      the scripture, of the miracles performed, &amp; etc.\\n&gt;&gt;      He is also told that to question this (as\\n&gt;&gt;      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n&gt;&gt;      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n&gt;&gt;      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\\n&gt;&gt;      Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n&gt;&gt;      scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n&gt;&gt;      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n&gt;&gt;      matter of course.\\n\\n&gt;You're missing something here.  There are people who convert from\\n&gt;non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\\n&gt;don't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\\n&gt;interesting thing to know.)  \\n\\nWell, I was raised as an athiest, and eventually took on a theistic\\nview. However I try to be a rationalist as well as a theist. Anyhow,\\nI will try to make some comments on your observations, just to \\ncontribute some datapoints from a different perspective.\\n\\n&gt;I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\\n&gt;naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\\n&gt;to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\\n&gt;nothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\\n\\nReligion _can_ be a crutch. Before going much further on that thread,\\nI would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world\\nreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well as\\ntheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge about\\nsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no such\\nclaims. \\n\\nMy perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is that\\ntalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about an\\nafterlife, then I'll start believing in one. In the mean while, my\\nreligion deals with what we know exists, that is life here and now.\\n\\n&gt;Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\\n&gt;science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\\n&gt;security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\\n\\nAgain, some religions do, and others do not. Some religions teach people\\nthat life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is.\\n\\n&gt;That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\\n&gt;has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\\n&gt;people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\\n&gt;belief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\\n&gt;useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\\n&gt;their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\\n&gt;(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\\n&gt;the harsh reality that they are running from).\\n\\nI'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic\\none because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better \\nexplained from the theistic perspective, while the athiestic perspective\\ncould not explain it. However that does not mean that I'm willing to\\naccept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern science\\nalong with my theistic perspective.\\n\\n&gt;&gt; \\n&gt;&gt;     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n&gt;&gt;    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n&gt;&gt;   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n&gt;&gt;        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n&gt;&gt; _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n&gt;Nanci\\n\\neric\\n</th>\n",

You still haven't offered\\n\\nI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than\\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got 'educated.'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and\\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\\ncaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually\\ndo this.\\n\\nRemember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live\\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\\n'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\\nus alive.\\n\\nI don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.

Automatic weapons, grenades, rocket launchers? The sorts of things\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;no family should be without, I guess.

It's hard to imagine a\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pistol-packin' Jesus, though I suppose a pump-action shotgun would have\\n&gt; &gt; &gt;made clearing the temple a hell of a lot easier.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Luke's account of the Last Supper.  \"...sell your cloak and buy a\\n&gt; sword.\"  Peter carried a sword (scene in Gethsemane).\\n&gt; \\n\\nI'm not expert on Christianity, but I know a little about history\\nand how the repeated instances of Messianic figures (jesus was neither\\nthe first, last nor most serious of those pretenders) related\\nto the history of the period.\\n\\nA messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the Romans!\\nHe was supposed to reclaim Israel and Judaea, bring the Israelites\\nback from what is now Iraq-Persia-Afghanistan, and do so\\nnot only by faith, but by real war.  Any Messianic pretender\\nwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since they\\nwere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free the\\nIsraelites.\\n\\nFor those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far more\\nseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and\\n600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was only\\nrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he looked\\nas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins before\\nthe Romans triumphed.\\n\\nNow how that has played into Christianity is rather interesting\\ngiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koresh\\nfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?\\nHad he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of\\nthe Israelites? (one hint, almost none of them are Christians,\\nlook at the three countries listed above, they were their\\nand Jewish until at least the 10th century)\\n\\n\\t\\tSeth Rosenthal\\n\\nDisclaimer: All opinions are my own not my employers'.\\n\\n</th>\n",

From the time he is born, the\\n&gt;&gt;      theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n&gt;&gt;      \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n&gt;&gt;      the Torah, the Qur'an, &amp; etc.  He is told\\n&gt;&gt;      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n&gt;&gt;      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n&gt;&gt;      the scripture, of the miracles performed, &amp; etc.\\n&gt;&gt;      He is also told that to question this (as\\n&gt;&gt;      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n&gt;&gt;      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n&gt;&gt;      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\\n&gt;&gt;      Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n&gt;&gt;      scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n&gt;&gt;      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n&gt;&gt;      matter of course.\\n\\n&gt;You're missing something here.  There are people who convert from\\n&gt;non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I\\n&gt;don't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an\\n&gt;interesting thing to know.)  \\n\\nWell, I was raised as an athiest, and eventually took on a theistic\\nview. However I try to be a rationalist as well as a theist. Anyhow,\\nI will try to make some comments on your observations, just to \\ncontribute some datapoints from a different perspective.\\n\\n&gt;I think that religion is a crutch.  People are\\n&gt;naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want\\n&gt;to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is\\n&gt;nothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.\\n\\nReligion _can_ be a crutch. Before going much further on that thread,\\nI would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world\\nreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well as\\ntheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge about\\nsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no such\\nclaims. \\n\\nMy perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is that\\ntalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about an\\nafterlife, then I'll start believing in one. In the mean while, my\\nreligion deals with what we know exists, that is life here and now.\\n\\n&gt;Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things\\n&gt;science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of\\n&gt;security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.\\n\\nAgain, some religions do, and others do not. Some religions teach people\\nthat life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is.\\n\\n&gt;That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This\\n&gt;has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these\\n&gt;people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their\\n&gt;belief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of\\n&gt;useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with\\n&gt;their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too\\n&gt;(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept\\n&gt;the harsh reality that they are running from).\\n\\nI'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic\\none because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better \\nexplained from the theistic perspective, while the athiestic perspective\\ncould not explain it. However that does not mean that I'm willing to\\naccept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern science\\nalong with my theistic perspective.\\n\\n&gt;&gt; \\n&gt;&gt;     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n&gt;&gt;    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n&gt;&gt;   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n&gt;&gt;        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n&gt;&gt; _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n&gt;Nanci\\n\\neric\\n</th>\n",
